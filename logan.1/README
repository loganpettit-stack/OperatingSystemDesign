GIT LOG: the log of all commits are stored in gitlog

OTHER: I have included a test directory with nested directories and files that contains a symbolic link to another test directory with nested directories and files. the test directory is named testDir which has a file that symlinks to testLinkdDir. 

PROBLEMS: I ran into a few problems when coming back to C for the first time in a while. I was overwriting memory locations with my queue, which I fixed up after a day. I covered my program with as much error handling as I could find and should not exit without a detailed error message that I have implemented.
